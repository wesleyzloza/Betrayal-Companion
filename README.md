## About
Betrayal Companion is an open source companion app for the popular board game Betrayal at House on the Hill. The app is designed to replace the need for multiple game pieces used within the board game. Use your phone, tablet, or PC to manage your explorer's traits; make virtual dice rolls; reveal the traitor and haunt number; and access the Secrets of Survival and Traitor's Tome game manuals. The app was originally created for Windows PCs, Windows Mobile, and Windows tablets but is being rebuilt for Android.
