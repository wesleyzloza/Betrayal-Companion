Even when he runs, the wind sometimes whispers in his ears, and he swears he can hear the Not Good Thing coming up behind him—fast. No wonder he’s the star of the track team. <br/><br/> Flash knows Jenny from the neighborhood. She’s okay, but she’s real quiet. He’s known Madame Zostra for his entire life. After all, he’s her nephew. Zoe’s his little cousin, but he’s only met her a couple of times.<br/><br/> Darrin’s greatest fear is that he’s going to be caught by the Not Good Thing (whatever it is).",

Sure, all older brothers pick on their younger siblings, but Peter’s brothers really pick on him. But what’s a few broken bones among family? Peter loves bugs and wants to be an entomologist when he grows up—an entomologist who never has to speak to his brothers.<br/><br/> Peter earns extra money taking care of Professor Longfellow’s yard (and finding cool bugs—bonus!). He knows Missy from school. She likes to do pretend medical exams on him and check out his real broken bones, but she doesn’t like it when he shows her his bug collection.<br/><br/> Peter’s greatest fear is that he’ll get trapped somewhereand never be able to escape.",

It’s located in the Library, the Chapel, the Vault, or the Attic. Once during your turn, you can attempt a Knowledge roll of 3+ in any of these rooms (the Vault must be open) to find it. If you succeed, search through the appropriate stack for a cursed weapon of your choice, take it, and reshuffle that stack.<br><br>The heroes must then figure out how to use the cursed weapon against Crimson Jack. A hero in the same room as the cursed weapon can attempt a Might roll or a Knowledge roll of 5+ to study the weapon. Each time an explorer succeeds, put a Might Roll or Knowledge Roll token (as appropriate) on that hero’s character card. When the heroes have a number of those tokens equal to the number of players, they understand how the cursed weapon can be used to kill Crimson Jack.<br><br>Thereafter, if any hero defeats Crimson Jack using the cursed weapon, Crimson Jack is killed permanently.<br><br><b>You Must Do This on Your Turn</b><br>Crimson Jack exudes an aura of fear. At the beginning of your turn, if you’re in the same room as Crimson Jack, you must succeed on a Sanity roll of 3+ or lose 1 point from a mental trait and 1 point from a physical trait.<br><br><b>If You Win...</b><br>Crimson Jack shivers on the end of the weapon, but he keeps pushing his way forward, that terrible smile never wavering.

There have been too many clues, too many coincidences, and too many revelations to doubt the reality of the pale hand now thrusting the lid completely open. The hand is coarse and broad, with squat fingers. Hair grows from the palm. The nails are long and fine and cut to a sharp point. The girl standing beside you clutches your arm.<br><br>'We have to kill it,' you yell, 'kill it before it completely awakens!'<br><br>That’s when you see the fresh bite marks on your friend’s neck and the new fangs in your friend’s mouth.<br><br><b>What You Know About the Bad Guys</b><br>The traitor and the Girl (now the Bride) are both Vampires in league with Dracula. Dracula is very powerful, but he awakens slowly. You have a couple of turns to act quickly before he is fully conscious. He and his minions will try to kill you or turn you into Vampires.<br><br><b>You Win When . . .</b><br>. . . Dracula and the Bride have both been destroyed.<br><br><b>How to Destroy Vampires</b><ul><li>If you use the Spear to defeat a Vampire with a Might attack, you stake its heart and kill it. Any other successful attack inflicts damage against the traitor, or stuns Count Dracula and the Bride, as normal.</li><li>The traitor is keeping track of the number of turns that pass after the haunt begins. Immediately after the traitor advances the Turn/Damage track, one of the other explorers rolls a number of dice equal to the number of players. When the result of that roll is lower than the current turn number, the sun comes up.</li><li>Vampires weaken as the day goes by. At the start of each traitor turn after the sun comes up, each Vampire (including Dracula, the Bride, and the traitor) loses 1 from each trait. Tell the traitor to keep track of Dracula's and the Bride's traits on a piece of paper. If a Vampire’s trait drops to 0 or to the skull symbol, it immediately bursts into flames and is destroyed.</li></ul><b>Special Attack Rules</b><br>If you defeat a Vampire, you inflict damage normally. If you are also carrying the Holy Symbol, you can force that Vampire to move one room away from you (through a connecting door) for each point of damage you inflict.<br><br><b>If You Win . . .</b><br><i>A stake through the heart, the light of the sun&mdash;these were your weapons against the blood-sucking scourge and its nightwalking children.

Discard the Girl card and put the Bride token (crimson) in your room.<br><br>Set up the Turn/Damage Track with a plastic clip at 0. You’ll need it to keep track of time.<br><br><b>What You Know About the Heroes</b><br>The sun is coming up soon. You need to kill the explorers quickly, because the Vampires will weaken as the sun moves higher. When this happens, the heroes will tell you how the sunlight affects the Vampires. Avoid rooms where sunlight can enter.<br><br><b>You Win When...</b><br>...all the heroes are dead or turned into Vampires.<br><br><b>You Must Do This On Your Turn</b><br>At the start of your turn, advance the Turn/Damage Track to the next number, beginning with 1.<br><br><b>Vampires</b><br>Dracula needs time to awaken. He doesn’t move or attack normally until Turn 2 (he can still defend against attacks.) Each time any Vampire tries to enter the Chapel or any room with an explorer who has the Holy Symbol, it must attempt a Sanity roll of 6+ to enter that room. A Vampire who fails that roll can’t enter that room.<br><br><b>Special Attack Rules</b><br><b>Domination:</b> When any Vampire attacks someone of the opposite sex, it can attempt a Sanity attack. If it defeats that character, that character takes Speed damage instead of mental damage. If the character defeats the Vampire, the Vampire takes no damage. This special attack can be used from an adjacent room with a connecting door. If a domination attack succeeds, you can also move the defeated hero into the Vampire’s room.<br><br>Once an explorer’s Speed has dropped to the skull symbol due to Domination, that character becomes a Vampire and is no longer a hero. (Have the player read this haunt in the Traitor’s Tome.) Raise that character’s Speed to its starting number. The newly created Vampire then adds 1 to each trait and is controlled by its player. It acts on its player’s turns. If the traitor wins and a Vampire has killed a hero, the player controlling that Vampire also wins.<br><br>Vampires can also attack and kill heroes normally -- this does not cause them to rise again as vampires.<br><br><b>If You Win...</b><br>More succulent than any fruit, the elixir of life throbs through your body like the dying heartbeat of your protesting meal.
