This requires a number of successful 'exorcism rolls' equal to the number of players. Each roll requires a specific room or item, and each one requires a Sanity roll or a Knowledge roll. You can make only one exorcism roll each turn.<ul><li>You can attempt a Sanity roll of 5+ to perform the exorcism while in the Chapel, Crypt, or Pentagram Chamber, or while holding the Holy Symbol or Ring.</li><li>You can attempt a Knowledge roll of 5+ to perform the exorcism while in the Library or Research Laboratory, or while holding the Book or Crystal Ball.</li></ul>Each time you succeed at an exorcism roll, put a Sanity or Knowledge Roll token (depending on the trait you used) on the room tile or item card that you used for that part of the exorcism. An exorcism token still counts toward your total even if the room or item with which it was accomplished is destroyed.<br><br>If the heroes successfully use an item or room as part of an exorcism roll, no explorer can use that item or room in an exorcism again. (For example, if you successfully perform a Sanity roll in the Chapel, then you can’t use the Chapel again.)<br><br>When the heroes have placed a number of these tokens equal to the number of players, the house stops collapsing.<br><br><b>You Must Do This on Your Turn</b><br>At the end of your turn, the traitor will tell you to turn over some room tiles in the house. These rooms have collapsed and are now part of the Abyss.<br><br><b>Dealing with the Abyss</b>The traitor is keeping track of the passage of time with the Turn/Damage Track.<br><br>If you’re carrying the Holy Symbol and you’re in a room adjacent to a destroyed room, you can sacrifice the Holy Symbol instead of turning over room tiles. (The adjacent room must have a connecting door.) When you do, discard that card; you no longer need to turn over those tiles. This also prevents the house from collapsing until the end of your next turn. It does not, however, stop the Turn/Damage Track from advancing.<br><br>If you’re in a room when the Abyss engulfs it, you must attempt a Speed roll of 4+ to escape. If you succeed, you can jump to an adjacent, non-collapsing, discovered room with a connecting door (if there is one). If you fail the roll, or if there isn’t a room you can use, you are sucked into the Abyss and killed.<br><br> If an event or Mystic Elevator roll sends you to a room or floor that has been destroyed, then you plummet into the Abyss. The Entrance Hall, Foyer, and Grand Staircase each count as a separate room. Use a token to indicate when each one is sucked into the Abyss.<br><br><b>If You Win...</b><br>The last incantation is over. The exorcism is finished. You wait, mentally pleading, praying, promising anything if only you are saved .... The house ceases rumbling. The gray mist pulls back. The red glow is extinguished. You sigh.

    "Ropy lengths of muscled tissue flail into view. Jagged, horn-rimmed suckers cover the boneless arm, pulsing and clicking like disembodied teeth. The rubbery length scuttles across a fellow explorer’s leg, then tightens convulsively.

A hero holding the ball must make a Knowledge roll of 4+ to gaze into it successfully, with the negative consequences listed on the card for an unsuccessful roll.

If you are defeated or tie, you take no damage, but your turn is over.<br><br><b>If You Win...</b><br>The sucker-rimmed tentacle lashes back and forth in agony, bringing down part of the ceiling and then one wall.

You don’t know how much time you have left. The traitor also holds a trigger capable of detonating the bombs, but only when in your room or a room adjacent to yours. (The adjacent room does not need to have a connecting door.)

If you have the Madman card, you can attempt the Knowledge roll at 5+ instead. (He recognizes the mad genius in the design.) A hero whose bomb is deactivated may discard his or her 'Victim' counter. If the result of the roll is 2 or less, you activate the time bomb, and all explorers in the same room blow up. All of their item and omen cards are discarded.<br><br>Instead of attempting to deactivate your own bomb, you can attempt to defuse someone else’s, if you are in the same room and you have that explorer’s permission. The Knowledge roll of 7+ (5+ with the Madman) still applies, as does the penalty for rolling a 2 or less.<br><br>The traitor will continue to work on the Big Bomb until you kill him.<br><br><b>If You Win...</b><br>The components of the demolitionist’s massive bomb lie scattered and inert.

Human body parts scattered through the hallways, half-gnawed and overcooked, lead to a severed human head on a silver platter.

When the traitor or a Cannibal Freak “feasts” on a Victim (by consuming the Victim’s brains or internal organs), that traitor or Cannibal Freak becomes more powerful. The traitor and other freakish cannibals also want to feast on you.<br><br><b>You Win When...</b><br>...the traitor and all of the Cannibal Freaks are dead, or all the Victims and all the heroes escape the house. If even one Victim or hero gets killed, you will have to defeat all the bad guys.<br><br><b>The Victims</b><br>Each time you get a Victim out the front door of the house, you’ll make it harder for the traitor to win. Once a Victim has gone out the front door, remove that token from the game.<br><br>The player to the left of the traitor moves the Victims at the start of his or her turn. Unless a hero is in the same room as a Victim, that Victim moves two rooms straight ahead. If it can’t move straight ahead, it turns to the next exit on its left and takes that exit. This is the only way that a Victim’s facing can change.<br><br>Victims react to house dangers and required rolls as if they were monsters. A Victim cannot go through an unexplored door.<br><br>A Victim stops its movement if it enters the same room as a hero. A Victim won’t move on its own as long as it’s in the same room as an explorer.<br><br>If a hero begins his or her turn in the same room as a Victim, that hero can move with the Victim two spaces in any direction before continuing to move and taking actions for that turn. A hero may only move one Victim at a time, but a Victim may be moved multiple times in a round by multiple heroes.<br><br>Traitors and Freaks do not slow Victims; Victims do not slow Traitors and Freaks.<br><br>You can attempt a Knowledge roll (picking the lock) or a Might roll of 5+to open the front door in the Entrance Hall. If you succeed, draw an Event card and end your turn.

It’s either the Axe, the Spear, or the Blood Dagger (your choice).<br><br>If the heroes don’t have the cursed weapon, they must search for it. It’s located in the Library, the Chapel, the Vault, or the Attic. Once during your turn, you can attempt a Knowledge roll of 3+ in any of these rooms (the Vault must be open) to find it. If you succeed, search through the appropriate stack for a cursed weapon of your choice, take it, and reshuffle that stack.<br><br>The heroes must then figure out how to use the cursed weapon against Crimson Jack. A hero in the same room as the cursed weapon can attempt a Might roll or a Knowledge roll of 5+ to study the weapon. Each time an explorer succeeds, put a Might Roll or Knowledge Roll token (as appropriate) on that hero’s character card. When the heroes have a number of those tokens equal to the number of players, they understand how the cursed weapon can be used to kill Crimson Jack.<br><br>Thereafter, if any hero defeats Crimson Jack using the cursed weapon, Crimson Jack is killed permanently.<br><br><b>You Must Do This on Your Turn</b><br>Crimson Jack exudes an aura of fear.
